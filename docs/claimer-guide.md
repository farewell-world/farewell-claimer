# Farewell Claimer Guide

This guide explains how to claim rewards from Farewell messages by proving email delivery using zk-email proofs.

## Overview

When someone passes away and their Farewell messages are released, claimers can:
1. Claim the message and download a claim package from the Farewell UI
2. Use this tool to decrypt the message (using the off-chain secret `s'`) and send it to the recipient
3. Prove delivery using zk-email
4. Claim any attached ETH reward

```
 Farewell UI                    farewell-claimer                 Farewell UI
 ───────────                    ────────────────                 ───────────
 Mark deceased                  Load claim package JSON          Upload proof JSON
 Claim & retrieve         ───>  Enter s' to decrypt        ───> Submit proofs on-chain
 Download claim package         Send email to recipient          Claim reward
                                Generate zk-email proof
```

## Prerequisites

- A claimed Farewell message (you must have called `claim()` on the contract)
- The off-chain secret `s'` (the recipient should have received this from the message sender)
- Access to an email account (Gmail recommended with OAuth 2.0)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- The [farewell-claimer](https://github.com/farewell-world/farewell-claimer) tool

## Step 1: Install the Claimer Tool

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/farewell-world/farewell-claimer.git
cd farewell-claimer

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Claim & Retrieve on the Farewell UI

1. Go to the [Farewell UI](https://farewell.world)
2. Navigate to the **Claim** tab
3. Enter the deceased user's address and message index
4. Click **Mark Deceased** (if not already done)
5. Click **Claim & Retrieve** — this calls `claim()` then `retrieve()` on the contract
6. You'll see the retrieved recipient email and sk share (the on-chain half of the decryption key)

## Step 3: Download the Claim Package

After claiming, click **Download Claim Package** to get a JSON file. This file contains:

```json
{
  "type": "farewell-claim-package",
  "recipients": ["recipient@example.com"],
  "skShare": "0x...",
  "encryptedPayload": "0x...",
  "contentHash": "0x...",
  "subject": "Farewell Message Delivery"
}
```

The message is still encrypted — the claim package contains the on-chain key share (`skShare`) but you need the off-chain secret (`s'`) to decrypt it.

## Step 4: Set Up Gmail OAuth (Recommended)

For the easiest experience, set up Gmail OAuth 2.0:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Gmail API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it
4. Create OAuth credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Desktop app" as application type
   - Download the JSON file
5. Save the file as `credentials.json` in the farewell-claimer directory

## Step 5: Send the Email

Run the claimer tool with the downloaded claim package:

```bash
python farewell_claimer.py farewell-claim-*.json
```

The tool will:
1. Detect the claim package format
2. **Prompt you for `s'`** (the off-chain secret the recipient received from the sender)
3. Decrypt the message using `sk = skShare XOR s'`
4. Ask you to select an email provider (Gmail OAuth recommended)
5. Show a summary of the decrypted message
6. Send the email with the `Farewell-Hash` embedded
7. Save the sent email as `.eml` and generate a proof structure

### Output Files

```
farewell_proofs_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── recipient_1_alice_at_example_com.eml    # Sent email for proof
└── proof_1_alice_at_example_com.json       # Proof data
```

## Step 6: Prove Delivery

1. Return to the [Farewell UI](https://farewell.world)
2. In the **Submit Proof** section (Step 3 of the Claim tab):
   - Upload the proof JSON generated by farewell-claimer
   - Click **Submit Delivery Proofs**
3. The proofs are verified on-chain

## Step 7: Claim the Reward

Once all recipients have been proven:

1. The **Claim Reward** button becomes active
2. Click it to withdraw the attached ETH reward
3. The reward is transferred to your wallet

## Alternative: Interactive Mode

If you don't have an export file, you can run the claimer in interactive mode:

```bash
python farewell_claimer.py
```

You'll be prompted to manually enter recipients, content hash, and message content.

## Email Provider Options

### Gmail with OAuth 2.0 (Recommended)
- No password needed
- Most secure option
- Requires one-time setup (see Step 4)

### Gmail with App Password
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication
- Generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)

### Other Providers
- **Outlook**: Use regular credentials
- **Yahoo**: Generate an [App Password](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/generate-third-party-passwords-sln15241.html)
- **iCloud**: Generate an [App-Specific Password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397)

## Troubleshooting

### "AES-GCM decryption failed"
- The `s'` value is likely incorrect. Double-check that you have the right off-chain secret.
- Make sure the `s'` is entered as a hex value starting with `0x`.

### "Authentication Failed"
- For Gmail, use OAuth 2.0 or an App Password (not your regular password)
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on your account

### "Connection Timeout"
- Check your internet connection
- Some networks block SMTP traffic on port 587

### "Email Not Delivered"
- Check the recipient's spam folder
- Verify the email address is correct

## Security Notes

- **Never commit** `credentials.json` or `token.json` to git
- **Keep `.eml` files secure** — they contain the full email content
- The `skShare` and `s'` together can decrypt the message — treat both as sensitive
- The `Farewell-Hash` in the email is used for proof verification, not for security

## How ZK-Email Proofs Work

The proof system verifies:
1. The email was signed with a valid DKIM signature (from a trusted provider like Gmail)
2. The recipient (TO field) matches the committed hash stored on-chain
3. The email body contains the correct `Farewell-Hash`

This proves the claimer actually sent the email without revealing the email content to anyone but the recipient and the verifier.
